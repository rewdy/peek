Wordpress theme for photo galleries

_This theme is still in development and is therefore probably not ready for use in the wild._

----

The photo galleries that it is currently designed to work with are:

* [ACF Gallery Field](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/gallery-field/)
* [BWS Gallery Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gallery-plugin/) - _Not necessarily all plugin display options are supported._

More may be added with time.

**Important Note:** Gallery styles are determined using post templates which require the use of the [WP Custom Post Template](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-custom-post-template/) plugin. Therefore, the WP Custom Post Template plugin is more or less a dependency.
